# Extended-Kalman-Filter-for-2D-Trajectory-Estimation-in-Navigation-Systems
In this project, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) was implemented to estimate the trajectory of a moving car in a 2D plane using noisy distance measurements from fixed control points. The EKF, an advanced state estimation technique for nonlinear systems, was employed to iteratively refine the car's position and velocity estimates. The project explored the impact of different noise covariances on the accuracy of the trajectory estimation, demonstrating the EKFâ€™s effectiveness in managing uncertainties and providing reliable state estimates even in the presence of measurement noise.
The techniques applied in this project have significant real-world implications, particularly in navigation and tracking systems. The EKF is widely used in autonomous vehicle guidance, where precise trajectory estimation is crucial for safe and efficient navigation. It's also essential in robotics for path planning and obstacle avoidance, as well as in GPS and sensor fusion applications, where it helps integrate data from multiple sources to improve accuracy. The ability to estimate trajectories accurately in dynamic and noisy environments makes the EKF a vital tool in these advanced technological fields.
